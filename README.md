This mod turns your good old Laika 601 into a better Laika 1.1. (It's just visual changes actually).

## How to install

### Automatic way:

<b><i>(requires you to have enabled JaDownloader in the in-game mod settings)</i></b>
Enter the following link in your browser<br>
`jaloader://install/jalopy-mods/Laika-1.1`<br><br>

### Manual way:

Download the latest release in the <b>Releases</b> part on the right of this page,<br>
Then you just have to download the zip file and extract it in your `Documents\Jalopy\Mods`<br>
<i>(so the DLL comes with the DLLs, and the assets gets into the Assets folder)</i>
